I'm Jeff and I love solving problems. I started my career doing technical support for an ISP and eventually moved on to IT infrastructure and information security. I've always had a strong interest in information security and I largely blame this on the excellent 1983 film "War Games" and the less-good-but-still-fun-to-watch 1995 film "Hackers". I love building things (virtually, anyway) and my Lego-infused childhood (ok, *and* adulthood) is the cause. When I can combine both and build something to solve a problem, it's an awesome feeling.

When I'm not working, I enjoy the usual nerd hobbies like video games, reading, and posting snarky comments on Internet forums. I also train in Karate, run, and bake bread whenever I can. I majored in music in college and I really want to play more, as it's been a while since I played regularly.

As for what's next, I want to help build something awesome to solve security problems that plague us all.
